The Laundry Alert is a new skill for the Jibo robot. It uses a Particle Photon and accelerometer to sense when a washing machine or dryer is done shaking and sends an IFTTT POST request to Jibo. Upon receipt of the request, Jibo plays a simple animation and alerts the user that their laundry is done.
